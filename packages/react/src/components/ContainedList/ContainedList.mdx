## Overview

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-containedlist--default" />

### Search

We have added in the capability to pass down the `Search` component within the `ContainedList` action prop.
The `Search` component itself is not a prop but does render with specific styling such that the `Search` bar appears below the Contained List title as opposed to rendering inline.
The `Search` component will also remain sticky under the title, so that it remains visible on scroll, when there are many list items passed in.
